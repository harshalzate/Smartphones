# Smartphones
Objective:
The project involves understanding and studying the smartphones data which contains all the smartphones available in the market and then performing the EDA to unveil hidden patterns.

The tasks involved in the project are as follows:

1: Gathering data

2: Assessing data
3: Cleaning data
4: Storing data
5: Analyzing, and visualizing data
6: Reporting
#About the dataset:
Data contains 1020 smartphones in the market with thier 10 features containing information about thier price,processing units,camers,os,battery etc.
